# How to run 
To run the program  open the Client class and run the main method.
By default the main method has some methods to populate a MeterArchive list and print out its contents.

The main method also has some commented methods, for easy testing of the different methods. Feel free to uncomment any of them to test the methods.

Optionally thereâ€™s an unfinished UI class called TestClass, where you can run the program with a simple UI.
